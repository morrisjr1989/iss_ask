  You are now at the Spacewalk help desk... to find the current location of the ISS, ask me... where is the ISS?
  to find when the iss will fly over a certain location ask me ... when will the ISS fly over city, state, or country,
  for example you can say,  Alexa - when will the iss fly over Atlanta, Georgia.
  Finally, you can access the credits. Ask me to 'roll credits'.
